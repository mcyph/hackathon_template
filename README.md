# React Spectre.css Kickstarter

In a similar spirit to the docs at 
https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter and 
https://www.thecodeship.com/general/hackathon-toolbox-essential-tools-practices/,
this repo contains a bunch of components based on the 
CSS UI framework 
[spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/)
which allows quickly building functional applications with rich UI 
components, charts and map visualizations for the purpose
of civic tech, hackathons and many other kinds of projects.
